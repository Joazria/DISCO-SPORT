      <p class="text-justify"><span class="text-danger">BIOGRAPHY</span> As sports TV rights are expected to significantly increase in the foreseeable future, Africa is about to fully exploit the economic potential of sports television. With new trends such as the growing popularity of eSports, the rise of mobile and online platforms, the advent of 5G, the impending direct-to-consumer fragmentation of the market, increased demand for sports apparel and increased participation of women in sport, health-conscious consumers, business opportunities abound for sports federations, platforms, content creators and advertisers.</p>

  <p class="text-justify">This is why we are launching DISCOSPORT, a new B2B market dedicated to sports television and the business of sports tv rights in Africa. The inaugural edition will take place in South Africa in September 2022. As a lead-in to DISCOSPORT, we are planning a 100% virtual informative and networking event set from Monday 25 October to Friday 19 November 2021. Our ambition is to already build momentum amongst key sports television industry executives with an eye on Africa and deliver in 2022 a dynamic, interactive and productive in-person event.</p>
